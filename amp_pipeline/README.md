## The AMP discovery pipeline </br>

# Description of the project: </br> 
Bacteria can rapidly evolve to develop resistance to antibiotics, presenting a growing and very dangerous problem. In a “post-antibiotic era”, bacterial diseases would once again be untreatable, and many standard treatments, including surgical operations, could become unusable. To boost the search for new treatment options, in a collaborative project, we are focusing on short proteins called antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which are produced naturally by various animal and plant species. These host defence proteins can protect against infection, or reduce the harm caused by an existing infection. (http://www.birollab.ca/projects)
