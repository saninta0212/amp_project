# The AMP discovery pipeline </br>

## Description of the [project](http://www.birollab.ca/projects): </br> 
Bacteria can rapidly evolve to develop resistance to antibiotics, presenting a growing and very dangerous problem. In a “post-antibiotic era”, bacterial diseases would once again be untreatable, and many standard treatments, including surgical operations, could become unusable. To boost the search for new treatment options, in a collaborative project, we are focusing on short proteins called antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which are produced naturally by various animal and plant species. These host defence proteins can protect against infection, or reduce the harm caused by an existing infection.

## Tasks that I perform: </br>
   - Writing scripts for the cleaving step of the AMP discovery pipeline in Python
   - Visualizing and analyze the results using several packages in R
   - Testing the scripts for all 84 datasets
   - Using Bash to write scripts to manipulate data, work on the command line, etc 
   - Working on how to refine and perform cleaving more accurately and hence started the sliding window cleaving project in order to predict the mature region of proteins more accurately
