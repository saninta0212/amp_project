# Mature-AMP project </br>

## Description of the project: </br>

## Tasks that I performed: </br>
   - Wrote a python script that can perform a *kmer* based cleaving of AMP precursor sequences given any value for the *kmer*
   - The cleaved pieces are then run on [AMPlify](https://github.com/bcgsc/AMPlify) to predict their ability to act as AMPs
   - Tested on known AMPs, known non-AMPs and unknown 84 datasets 
   - Wrote R scripts that can visualize the results and plot AMPlify score for the pieces which can help us determine phase transition and hence mature regions of        the Antimicrobial peptides more accurately
